## How To Use
> The application contains a map of UCR and shows markers pointing to restrooms in every building on campus. The markers are color-coded in the following:

![#AFE1AF](https://placehold.co/15x15/AFE1AF/AFE1AF.png) - Very clean/accessible

![#FAFA33](https://placehold.co/15x15/FAFA33/FAFA33.png) - Slightly clean/accessible

![#DC143C](https://placehold.co/15x15/DC143C/DC143C.png) - Not clean/accessible

> Students can click on markers to view current reviews for all the restrooms in the building. If they want to add reviews, they can do so with the "Add Review" button in the main map page, which directs them to a Google Form.
